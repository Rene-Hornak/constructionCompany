Thank you Infotech for the opportunity to try something new. I didn't have experience with Devexpress or DevExtreme.
As for Visual Studio, I've done it in the past, but I had to try it all over again.

Otherwise, I have learned how to work with Devexpress, how to work better with Visual Studio and many challenges with C#.
It was difficult, but also fun.

I worked with the look to make it as modern as possible, but there is still work to be done on editing.

I have learned a lot and will continue to do so.

Thank you Infotech
